## Rules

### Documentation

- Every repo should contain an updated readme file.

  3. Describe how to use your project, including code examples or screenshots.


### Code

- Use descriptive naming of variables, functions and classes
- Avoid duplicating code by creating reusable functions or modules.
- All code and comments should be written in English.

### Security

- Avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages.

### Testing

- Write unit tests for critical parts of your code
- Separate source code from testing code in different folders
